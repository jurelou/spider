# spider
This project consists in a keylogger software, using a client/server architecture.
This project is divided in two parts:
• The client runs on Windows.
• The server runs on Unix.
On Windows, you MUST use Microsoft Visual Compiler (MSVC) to build this project.

The Spider project aims to create a keylogger “network” with many clients and one or more
servers.
